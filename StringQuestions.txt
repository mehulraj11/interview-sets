---1> Count vowels & consonants in a string.
if("aeiou".indexOf(c) != -1)
---2> Convert string to uppercase but only alternate characters should change.
---3> Reverse a string without using built-in reverse().
---4> Find the number of words in a sentence without using split().
---5> Replace all spaces with - (dash) manually without replace().
---6> Print the string in reverse order word-wise.
input : "I love Java"
output: "Java love I"
---7> Remove duplicate characters from a string while keeping original order.
---8> Count frequency of each character and print character with highest freq.
9>Shift each character by +2 in alphabet (a→c, y→a, etc.) like Caesar Cipher.
(char) ((c - 'a' + key) % 26 + 'a');
10>Check if one string is rotation of another.
"abcde" & "cdeab" → true
return (s1 + s1).contains(s2);
---11> Capitalize the first letter of every word manually.
---12> Find the longest word from a sentence.
---13> Count occurrences of each word in a sentence. (use maps or without maps)
---14> Swap first and last character of every word.
---15> Check if two strings are anagrams without using sorting.
16> Print all substrings of a string.
17>Find the longest palindromic substring.
---18>Given a string, remove characters appearing more than once.
---19>Compress a string like:
input : aaabbcccaaa → output : a3b2c3a3
---20>Reverse characters in each word but keep order of words same.
---21>Sort words of a sentence based on their length.
22>Count only consonants of each word (same as before but modify to show only words with highest consonant count).
---23> Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
---24>Check if string contains only alphabets (no digits, no symbols).
25>Convert a sentence to title format (like Book Title Rules — skip small words such as "is", "an", "the").
26 >a2b3c1 → expand → aabbbc
---27> Detect if a sentence is pangram (contains A–Z at least once).
---28> Reverse only vowels, keep consonants fixed.
29> Print words sorted by vowel count.
30> Generate the next alphabetical string sequence:
"azz" → "baa"

freq -> 8, 18, 23, 15, 27, 9, 29
split() -> 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 25, 29, 1
two pointer -> 3, 6, 16, 17, 28, 30
manual iteration logic(no builts-in) -> 2, 4, 5, 7, 24, 26, 9, 30
